[This is still a WIP - any updates will be here]

## Skidmenu
Skidmenu is a free, open-source lua menu for FiveM.

> Note: Anyone is free to use this menu and modify it as they please. All I ask in return is that you do not try to monetize this release, I made this because I was tired of seeing people trying to sell the same old reused code and charging ridiculous amounts for it
